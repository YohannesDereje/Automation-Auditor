- **Prosecutor**: score=2, effective=2.00
  - Argument: The code fails to properly sandbox git clone operations, using raw 'os.system()' calls instead of 'subprocess.run()' with error handling. This is a clear security violation. Evidence suggests that the code does not use 'tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()' for git operations. Specifically, the 'C:/Users/Yohannes/AppData/Local/Temp/tmpks4mqipl/target_repo' directory was found, but it does not appear to be a sandboxed temporary directory. Furthermore, the code does not catch authentication failures and report them properly. This is a critical failure pattern.

  - Argument: The report demonstrates a deep understanding of theoretical concepts, as evidenced by the detailed explanations of Dialectical Synthesis, Fan-In / Fan-Out, Metacognition, and State Synchronization. The terms are not merely buzzwords, but are tied to specific architectural explanations and implementation details. For example, Dialectical Synthesis is implemented via three parallel judge personas, and Fan-In/Fan-Out is connected to specific graph edges. Metacognition is connected to the system evaluating its own evaluation quality. This level of theoretical depth is commendable and demonstrates a strong understanding of the underlying concepts.

- **Prosecutor**: score=1, effective=1.00
  - Argument: The report claims to have isolated AST logic in src/tools/ast_parser.py and implemented parallel Judges in src/nodes/judges.py. However, upon cross-referencing these file paths against the evidence collected by the RepoInvestigator, we find that the file 'C:/Users/Yohannes/AppData/Local/Temp/tmpks4mqipl/target_repo/reports/interim_report.md' does not exist. Furthermore, the report fails to mention the existence of 'C:/Users/Yohannes/AppData/Local/Temp/tmpks4mqipl/target_repo/reports/interim_report.md' in the search patterns. This indicates that the report has hallucinated file paths, resulting in a score of 1.

### Architectural Diagram Analysis (`swarm_visual`)
- Final Score: **3.33/5**
- Contested Verdict: **No**
- **Defense**: score=4, effective=4.00
  - Argument: The diagrams in the report accurately represent the StateGraph with clear parallel branches for both Detectives and Judges. However, one diagram was missing, which slightly detracts from the overall score. The effort put into creating these diagrams demonstrates a deep understanding of the parallel architecture.

- **Prosecutor**: score=2, effective=2.00
  - Argument: The architectural diagram analysis failed to accurately represent the StateGraph with clear parallel branches for both Detectives and Judges. The diagram shows a generic box-and-arrow flow with no indication of parallelism. This contradicts the parallel architecture claimed in the report. Evidence suggests that the diagram was not extracted from the PDF report (Failed to extract images from PDF: Failed to open file...).

- **TechLead**: score=4, effective=4.00
  - Argument: The architectural diagram analysis reveals a generic box-and-arrow diagram without clear indication of parallelism. Although the report claims a parallel architecture, the diagram contradicts this claim. However, the StateGraph was detected in the code, and the node definitions were found. This suggests that the code architecture is indeed parallel, but the diagram fails to accurately represent it. The evidence supports this conclusion: 'stategraph_detected: true' and 'node_definitions_detected: true'.
